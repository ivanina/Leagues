	Suicide Rules<br/>
	<li class="inline">$20 to entry.</li>

	<li class="inline">This is a separate pool from the regular pool.</li>
	<li class="inline">You must choose 1 team every week to win without the spread.</li>
	<li class="inline">If you forget to pick it is counted as a loss.</li>
	<li class="inline">Picks must be in by start of the first game of the week.</li>
	<li class="inline">You can only pick the team once for the year.</li>
	<li class="inline">2 Loses and you are out of the pool.</li>
	<li class="inline">Last person in the pool collects 80% of the money.</li>
	<li class="inline">Second to last person out collects 20% of the money.</li>
	<li class="inline">Ties will be broken by first number of loses.  A person with 0 loses always beats a person with 1 lose.  If two people are tied at the end of the year with the same number of loses then spread will be used to determine the winner.  The system will add up all the spreads for all the picks you picked.  The person with the highest number will be the winner.  If a tie still remains the money will be split.</li>
