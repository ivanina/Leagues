page.suicide=In order to start a NFL suicide pool league all you need to do is name and create your league following the easy step-by-step instructions provided for you.  We provide you with weekly summaries of overall pool performance.  This includes the number of players who have survived to date, the number of players who were eliminated, and the picks each player made each week and their spread differential (if your league uses spreads).\nThe rules of the NFL suicide pool are simple and easy to follow.  Every player must choose 1 team per week to win independent of any point spread. If your league uses spreds, the point spreads will only be used in the event of a tie at the end of the year. You may only select a team once for the entire season.  Each selection must be entered before the start of the first game of the week.  If you forget to make a selection it is counted as a loss.  Changes to selection may be made at any time up to the stated deadline.  A player accumulating two losses is out of the pool.  In the event of a tie it will be broken first by the number of loses. example\: A player with 0 loses always beats one with one lost.  If two players are tied at the end of the year with the same number of loses then the spread differential will be used to determine the winner.  The system will add up all the spreads for teams the player has picked.  The player with the lowest spread differential will be declared the winner.   If a tie still remains the players will be declared equal winners.
page.football=The NFL football pool is played by picking who you believe will be the winning team of each game played during that week. You will also choose a "Double" which will count for 2 points for the week.  As the league creator you will be given options to customize your league such as, whether or not to use point spreads.  Players can Make Your Picks as early in the season as you want right up to the start of each game. note\: if playing with point spreads, the official spreads will not be available until the wednesday of that week. Once the official starting time for the game has passed that game will become locked so that no changes can be made. Make Your Picks will keep track of each players wins and keep a scoreboard for all the players in your league. You will be able to view each players picks after the lockout time has passed.
