<ul>
	<li>Q: What if the league creator fails to make the the payment before the start of the season?</li>
	<li>A: If the payment is not received before the first game of season an email notification will be sent to the league creator. Players will still be able to play the first week of the season. If the payment is not received before the end of the first week the league will be cancelled.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>

	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  Can I add people to the league once the season has started?</li>
	<li>A:  You can add more people to the league at anytime.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  Do I have to pick all the games if a game is on Thursday or just the Thursday night game?</li>

	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  Where do you get the spreads from?</li>
	<li>A:  It shouldn't matter where I get them from as they are the same for everyone but if you really want to know I get them from.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  Do the spreads change once they are entered?</li>
	<li>A:  No.  Once they are in, they are in.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  What day are weeks setup and spreads entered?</li>
	<li>A:  It depends on the week.  If there is a Thursday night game I try and get them entered earlier in the week.  At the very latest they are entered on Wednesday.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Q:  I am too many pools in my navigation.  How do I get rid of them?</li>
	<li>A:  If you go to My Account it will list all the leagues you are apart of.  There you can click on the link that says Show in Nav for each pool to remove it.</li>
